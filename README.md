## Example of my Work

|The aim of this applied research is to contribute to the automation of visual inspection as part of the quality control of 3D printed parts with a complex geometry. The project took place in the WEMAKE company that specialized in 3D printing, with the goal of designing and implementing a tool that is capable of preventing and correcting imperfections that occur mid printing. In this memory we used at first the advanced image processing along with a depth camera and 3D models processing in order to be able to compare  point by point the two cloud points, then we made a software to automate the process of 3D printing |<img src ="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChihebMadiouni/ChihebMadiouni/main/preview%20Inspcetion%20.png" width ="250" height ="25">|
|NEMS is a home assist robot equipped with a state of the art technologies, this self balancing robot has an AI driven speech recognition algorithm, face and obstacle detection. This robot features a friendly interface with interactive voice commands. This robot is also controlled via Myo EMG sensors  |<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChihebMadiouni/ChihebMadiouni/main/Sans%20titre-1.png" width = "350" hight = "100">|
|3D printer control mother board equipped with trinamic silent stepper drivers this board is capable of running 4 steppers and 2 Extruders. This motherboard is equipped with an avr mcu and can communicate to a host via a USB or wirelessly via local wifi.  |<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChihebMadiouni/ChihebMadiouni/main/1627059838857.jpg" width = "250" hight = "100">|
|This is a belt system destined to be mounted on Cartesian 3D printer, this improvement can transform any 3D printer into a micro factory.  |<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChihebMadiouni/ChihebMadiouni/main/belt.png" width = "250" hight = "100">|
|3D printer farm monitoring software, through this software you can control and monitor multiple 3D printers in real time.  |<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChihebMadiouni/ChihebMadiouni/main/main%20window%20%E2%80%93%201.png" width = "250" hight = "100">|
